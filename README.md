## How I Solved Them

- Used **JOINs** to connect related tables and retrieve linked data.
- Applied **aggregate functions** like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to summarize information.
- Filtered data with **WHERE** clauses and **HAVING** clauses for filtering data.
- Applied **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** to organize, to highlight key trends and rank results.
- Used **subqueries** to filter data relative to overall metrics (e.g., films above average rental rate).
- Used **LEFT JOIN** or **NOT EXISTS** to identify missing relationships (e.g., films never rented, customers with no rentals).
